i.Git <br />
  "Version Control" software that keeps track of the entire history of what your working on. This tool includes collaboration, allowing you to work on a project with others, at    the same time. <br />
ii.Github <br />
  A website that allows you to do Git stuff on a server. Github runs Git behind the scenes, and projects are managed through it collaboratively. <br />
iii. Repo <br />
  A Github Repository is basically a project that holds all the files needed. <br />
iv. Commit <br />
  Like a "save" button. You commit any changes you made to the file. Each commit can have a note to it, using the description. <br />
  Like this: This entire line was added after the first commit!
